Movie Collection Dataset with Linear Regression
Overview
This repository contains a dataset of movie collections, along with a linear regression analysis to predict the potential revenue based on various features. The dataset includes information such as budget, genre, runtime, and release date, among others. The goal is to build a linear regression model that can help estimate the expected revenue of a movie given certain characteristics.

Linear Regression Analysis
The notebook covers the following steps:
Data Exploration: Exploring the dataset to understand the distribution of variables, identify missing values, and visualize relationships between features.
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, converting categorical variables into numerical representations, and scaling numerical features.
Linear Regression Model: Building a linear regression model using the scikit-learn library to predict movie revenue based on selected features.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the linear regression model using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
Prediction Example: Demonstrating how to use the trained model to make revenue predictions for new movie data
